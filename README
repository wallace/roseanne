A simple rails web application that diffs the pasted text.  You can diff in
client side javascript or server side ruby.  Server side ruby stores the diffed
text into couchdb for later review.

You need to set up the access for couchdb backend.  Something like
'http://username:password@host.domain.com:port/database_name'
